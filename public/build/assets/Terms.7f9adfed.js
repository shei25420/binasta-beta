(vi) Proprietary information is transmitted to the Distributor in confidence and, but for this agreement of confidentiality and non- disclosure, the Company would not provide this information to the Distributor. (vii) Distributors agree not to disclose such information to any third party or use such information for non-company purposes or to compete with the Company. (viii) The Distributor acknowledges that such proprietary information is of such character as to render it unique and that disclosure or use thereof in violation of this provision will result in irreparable damage to the Company and to Independent Distributor businesses.

(x) The Company and its independent Distributors will be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent violation of this policy.

(xii) The Company prohibits Distributors from selling or promoting another Company\u2019s products, along with the Company\u2019s products, on any physical or virtual sites, displays, or advertisements. (xiii) Distributors are independent contractors, and the Company imposes no restrictions on any Distributor\u2019s participation or sales activities in other multi-level marketing or direct sales opportunities, so long as it is not an opportunity that directly competes with Binasta. (xiv) Should they elect to participate in other non-competing direct selling opportunity, Distributors agree to maintain separate organizations independent of one another. Distributors will not engage in cross sponsoring. This policy shall apply to all countries in which the Company officially operates and shall survive the cancellation of this Agreement. (xv) Violation of the letter and/or spirit of the P&P constitutes voluntary resignation and cancellation of the Independent Distributor Agreement, effective the date of the violation, and the forfeiture of all commissions/bonuses payable for and after the calendar month in which the violation occurred.
